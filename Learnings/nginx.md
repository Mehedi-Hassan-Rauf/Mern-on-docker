# NGINX

The og tool that can be used as reverse proxy the way I am using.  
As loadbalancer, I will be using.  

Its dope.

We just need to write a conf file   
similar to writing a json file. 

The syntax is just wow.

Next, it takes care of everything magically.  
Thanks from the deepest of my heart to the creator.
